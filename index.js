let testP = `S everal books have been written in English about the Mongol
conquests, the subsequent empires which the Mongols ruled, the
travellers who visited them and even the diplomatic relations
between their khans and the papacy. But nothing has been written
about the Mongol invasion of Europe. In this book I have rashly
endeavoured to fill that gap. But I did not set out to write a
detailed account of every event that took place in Europe during
the invasion. I have simply attempted to tell the story of an
extraordinary campaign, outline its causes and far-reaching consequences and place it in its historical perspective.
The contemporary sources were written in more than ten languages and it is unlikely that anyone could read them all in their
original. Fortunately, however, most of the Middle Eastern and
Oriental sources have been translated into at least one European
language by eminent scholars who have added their own notes and
commentaries. These translations are listed in the Bibliography
and their notes and commentaries were often my guides when the
Latin sources were contradictory and the bias of modern Central
European historians was obvious. I must also acknowledge that I
could not have found my way through the maze of contemporary
sources without the further guidance of the leading histories of the
Mongol period, particularly the works of G. Vernadsky, B. Spuler,
I. de Rachewiltz and J.J. Saunders, and above all the notes and
articles of P. Pelliot.
There are now many ways of spelling Mongol names. In the past
Europeans based their transliteration on Arabic. Thus, for example, since there is no ‘ch’ in Arabic, Chingis Khan was spelt
Jingis Khan and then Genghis Khan. But today it is more common
to present the names in a form that is closer to their Oriental pronunciation and this I have attempted to do. However, I have also
Xll PREFACE
tried to spell them in a way which will be easy to read and where
the Oriental form is very different from the older European
spelling, I have only adapted the older form to bring it closer to
the Oriental without making it unrecognizable.
Finally I would like to thank Sheila Murphy for her encouragement, Christopher Falkus for his infectious enthusiasm and
confidence, my editor, Christine Sandeman, for her patience and
judgement, and my wife Josephine for her tolerance.

The First Move West
I n the late winter of 1220, Ali ad-Din boarded the only remaining
fishing boat in the village of Astara on the shores of the Caspian
Sea and sailed out towards the island of Abeskum.
As he passed through the village dressed in rags, he and his
handful of followers appeared to be nothing more than another
group of refugees, but a few months before Ali ad-Din had been
Muhammad Ali Shah, Emperor of Khwarizm, Transoxiana and
Khurasan. His rich empire had stretched from the Persian Gulf and
the Caspian Sea to the river Indus and the Hindu Kush, yet in
those few months he had lost it all; and as the boat pulled away
the shore behind became thick with mounted archers charging
hopelessly into the water, their arrows falling short in its wake.
When he came to the throne of Khwarizm in 1200 as
Muhammad II, Ali ad-Din also inherited the enormous army with
which he had already begun the easy conquest of Khurasan. His
empire had been founded by Khutbeddin Muhammad, a Turkish
mercenary who had governed the area on behalf of the Seljuks and
acquired enough wealth and power to declare independence.
Although the indigenous population was Persian, Muhammad n ’s
courtiers and soldiers were the Turkish descendants of
Khutbeddin’s mercenaries, and the fierce corps of horsemen who
formed his bodyguard were Kanglis, a tribe of Kipchaks or eastern
Cumans from the steppes beyond the Aral Sea, imported by his
mother Turkan Khatun, who was the daughter of their chief.
Against such soldiers as these the peaceful Persian people of
Khurasan could offer no more than token resistance.
Although he was ambitious, Muhammad was irresolute and unimaginative. He bolstered his lack of security with the strength of
his army and camouflaged his lack of confidence with vanity. The
easy conquest of his ill-defended neighbours offered him the
1
2 THE DEVIL'S HORSEMEN
opportunity not only to indulge an army that was too large to
justify in time of peace, but also to increase his own wealth and
enhance his reputation. Continuing the campaign that he had
begun under his father, he led his army through the rich, irrigated
farm lands that had once been desert, secured the ancient cities and
annexed the whole of Khurasan to his empire. The operation took
not much longer than the time required foi* his army to cover the
distance, but it brought him the prestige that he longed for. While
he proclaimed himself to the world as ‘the chosen prince of Allah’
and his sycophantic courtiers nicknamed him the second Alexander,
his neighbours, fearful of his army and his ambition, began to offer
him tribute and allegiance.
To the east of Muhammad's empire lay the empire of
Transoxiana and to the north-east of that, the powerful Buddhist
empire of Kara Khitai, which bordered the eastern steppes and
screened the kingdoms of Islam from the new empire of the nomad
Mongols. When Muhammad, ‘the chosen prince of Allah’, refused
to pay any further tribute to the infidel rulers of Kara Khitai,
Osman, Emperor of Transoxiana, transferred his own allegiance
from Kara Khitai to Khwarizm. Both Osman and Muhammad
believed that internal struggles would prevent the Buddhist army
from protecting its interests, but when Kara Khitai was invaded
from the east by the Mongols, Muhammad saw the chance that
even his caution could not resist While Kara Khitai fell to
the Mongols the Khwarizmian army marched almost unopposed
into Transoxiana. By opportunism, and without ever really testing
his army in the field, Muhammad had made himself one of
the most powerful rulers in Islam and with the revenues of
Transoxiana in his coffers he was unquestionably the richest.
Lying between the Amu Darya and the Syr Darya, rivers which
were known in the west as the Oxus and the Jaxartes, desolated in
the north by the impenetrable desert of Kizil Kum and only made
fertile in the south by extensive irrigation, Transoxiana was not
rich in natural resources, but across its heart ran the overland trade
routes of the world. At the eastern end of the road on the Syr Darya
stood the commercial centre of Khojend, in the west near the Amu
Darya the mosques, universities and carpet warehouses of Bukhara
and between them the city that Muhammad II had chosen for his
new capital, Samarkand.
Huge suburbs shaded by poplar trees and decorated with
THE FIRST MOVE WEST 3
fountains and canals surrounded a city so rich that even within its
walls every house had a garden. In the factories the citizens wove
silk, cotton and silver lame, the Persian craftsmen worked saddles,
harnesses and decorated copper and the workshops of the Chinese
quarter produced the rag paper that was used throughout the
Middle East. From the fields beyond the suburbs the farmers
exported melons and aubergines wrapped in snow and packed in
lead boxes. The vast population exceeded five hundred thousand.
It was in Samarkand that Muhammad's courtiers housed their
treasures and their harems and lived in a splendour that was
unequalled even in the east; it was from there that they rode out to
hunt dressed in cloth of gold with tame cheetahs clinging on to the
saddles behind them.
Muhammad settled down to enjoy the magnificence of his new
capital, but he did not disband his army. An avaricious tax collector, he was as unpopular among the Persian inhabitants of his huge
empire as were his plundering Turkish soldiers. To allay his fears
of rebellion the army had to be kept at full strength and to keep
that army contented and maintain his reputation as a conqueror he
would occasionally lead it out on minor expeditions against neighbouring cities in the south. Muhammad Shah’s Persian subjects
were, however, helpless. They could turn only to their religious
leaders, but these were engaged in a series of sectarian quarrels,
and Nasir, Caliph of Baghdad, and spiritual ruler of Islam, had
neither the temporal power nor the unity to offer anything more
than a desultory chain of hopeless intrigues.
It was after his siege of Ghazna in 1216 that Muhammad first
learned of these intrigues. The threat was insignificant, but
Muhammad was a timid man. He determined to depose the caliph
and replace him with a puppet. Receiving the submission of
Azerbaijan and Fars which lay along his route, he marched his
army towards Baghdad. It was as though the Holy Roman
Emperor were to lead an army towards the gates of Rome. But if
the caliph was powerless, Allah was not. The army was dispersed
in the mountains by a fierce snowstorm and many of those who did
not die of exposure had their throats cut by Kurdish bandits.
Muhammad was forced to withdraw, and for the time being, the
caliph survived.
Returning to Bukhara the shah found three ambassadors waiting
for him. They were men of Khwarizmian origin who had been
4
THE D E V IL ’S HORSEMEN
living in Kara Khitai and they carried gifts so precious that even
the shah was impressed: gold ingots and a huge gold nugget, jade
and ivory ornaments and cloaks spun from the wool of white
camels. When they had laid these before him they delivered a
letter.
I send you these gifts. I know your power and the vast extent of your
empire and I regard you as my most cherished son. For your part you
must know that I have conquered China and all the Turkish nations
north of it; my country is an anthill of soldiers and a mine of silver and I
have no need of other lands. Therefore I believe that we have an equal
interest in encouraging trade between our subjects.
Beneath the letter was a seal and on it inscribed, ‘God in heaven,
the Kah Khan, the power of God on Earth. The Seal of the
Emperor of Mankind.’
That evening the shah dined with the ambassadors. If the unconcluded feud with the caliph and the depletion of his army had
not embarrassed the ‘chosen prince of Allah’ with more insecurity
than he could tolerate, he might well have treated the infidel
barbarians with the contempt that they deserved. He knew very
little about the Mongol conquerors from the east, although selfinterest had made him send messages of good will during the
invasion of Kara Khitai, but if the khan could be trusted the
advantages of a trade agreement were obvious. He questioned his
guests, asking if the ‘Emperor of Mankind’ was really as powerful
as his letter claimed, and the ambassadors, forewarned of his
vanity, replied tactfully that although powerful, he was not as
powerful as the shah; and they answered honestly when they said
that he did not have as many soldiers.
Muhammad seemed satisfied by the flattery and by 1218 a
commercial treaty had been signed. Khwarizmian trade with the
east could now continue unaltered by the spread of Mongol rule
and protected by an alliance too powerful to be challenged.
The Caliph of Baghdad, growing hysterical as he watched the
shah’s army regaining its strength, decided to make one last effort
to save his neck and sent a secret messenger to the Mongol khan
pleading for his intervention and warning him not to trust the
ambitious shah. So elaborate were his precautions that the message
was tattooed on to the envoy’s shaved head and he was not allowed
to set out until the hair had grown again. But the effort was wasted.
At the Mongol capital of Karakorum the messenger was told that`;
